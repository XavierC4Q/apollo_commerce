# Test Shopping Application Part 2

My commerce application. Now refactored to use Apollo Server so I can better take advantages of interfaces and (possibly) directives.

## Stack
* Express
* Node
* Postgres
* Graphql
* React/Apollo

Backend currently in progress. Plan is to build all the functionality a shopping application would need including searching different selections and orders and past orders.

At the moment, very basic features for products and users are in. Next steps are fleshing out all the subcategories, adding an orders table and expanding the queries. Also wish to better separate the male/female/child sizes and colors.
